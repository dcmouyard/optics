      <summary>virtual image</summary>
      <p>An image formed when the outgoing rays from a point on an object always diverge. The image appears to be located at the point of apparent divergence. Because the rays never really converge, a virtual image cannot be projected onto a screen.</p>
      <p>In diagrams of optical systems, virtual rays are conventionally represented by dotted lines. Virtual images are located by tracing the real rays that emerge from an optical device (lens, mirror, or some combination) backward to a perceived point of origin.</p>

      <summary>visible light spectrum</summary>
      <p>The portion of the electromagnetic spectrum that is visible to the human eye.</p>
      <p>Wavelengths are between 400nm (violet) to 700nm (red).</p>
      <p>Frequencies are between 428THz (red) and 749THz (violet).</p>

      <summary>vitreous humor</summary>
      <p>The clear gel that fills the space between the lens and the retina of the eye. It helps to keep the retina in place by pressing it against the choroid.</p>
      <p>Also known as the vitreous body.</p>

    <details>
      <summary>wavelength</summary>
      <p>The distance between two successive crests of a wave.</p>
      <p>The wavelength is equal to the speed of the wave divided by the frequency the wave.</p>
      <p>Often defined as <var>λ</var> in diagrams and equations.</p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>x-rays</summary>
      <p>Electromagnetic radiation with shorter wavelengths than ultraviolet and longer wavelengths than gamma rays in the electromagnetic spectrum.</p>
      <p>Wavelengths are between 10pm and 10nm.</p>
      <p>Frequencies are between 30PHz and 30EHz.</p>
