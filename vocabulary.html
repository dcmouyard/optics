      <summary>optical power</summary>
      <p>The degree to which a lens, mirror, or other optical system converges or diverges light, usually measured in diopters. Thus this is another way of describing how much this lens, mirror, or optical system magnifies images.</p>
      <p>Converging lenses have positive optical power, while diverging lenses have negative power.</p>
      <p>For two or more thin lenses close together, the optical power of the combined lenses is approximately equal to the sum of the optical powers of each lens: <span class="equation"><var>P</var> = <var>P₁</var> + <var>P₂</var></span>. Similarly, the optical power of a single lens is roughly equal to the sum of the powers of each surface. These approximations are commonly used in optometry.</p>
